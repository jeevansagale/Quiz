# 🎯 Quiz Application (C++ | raylib)

A simple Quiz Game built using C++ and the raylib graphics library.

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand game loops, UI rendering, input handling, and basic logic structuring in C++.

## 🧠 About the Project

This quiz application displays questions on screen, allows the user to select answers, and evaluates the response in real time.
It focuses more on learning raylib and C++ basics rather than being a fully polished product.

### Key goals of this project:

* Learn how raylib works

* Practice C++ logic and structure

* Understand simple game/app flow

* Database connection and understanding 

* Experiment with UI using shapes and text

## 🚀 Features

* Interactive quiz interface

* Multiple-choice questions

* Keyboard / mouse input handling

* Different times for each question 

## 🛠️ Built With C++ raylib (graphics & input handling)


## ▶️ How to Run

* Run the executable (Windows)

* Download the repository

* extract the folder

* Run the .exe file


## 📚 What I Learned

* Using raylib for graphics and input

* Structuring a basic game/application loop

* Handling user input in C++

* Managing simple UI logic

* Database management
